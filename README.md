## Description:

**What Tripletail does**: Help the worlds best software engineers build stronger Github profiles and ultimately get hired. Tripletail provides software engineers with real time metrics about the quality of their Github profile and how they stack up in the community.

**How we do it**: Tripletail retrieves relevant user data from the Github API via Github OAuth and visualizes it with avatars and rankings.
These metrics include but are not limited to:

  - Number of directories with README’s
    - Number of followers
      - Number of public repo’s
        - Number of commits
          - Hire-ability ranking
            - User bio

## About

Tripletail is a web application that was developed in 24 hours by a team of seven engineering students at Holberton School. In this time we built a working frontend and backend, as well as deployed it to the cloud. Tripletail is affiliated with Holberton (est. 2015), a world leader in software engineering education.
